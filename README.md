# Notes
Spring &amp; Hibernate web application 

## Description
This web application was created in order to make notes and have quick access to them. You can create an account, log in and start
using. Inputs have validation. Users' passwords are stored in the database protected by BCrypt algorithm. You can do CRUD operations on notes.
There is a feature that allows you to sort your jottings by the priority and the date. There is one REST controller (for testing in Postman). In project I used bootstrap templates (links at the bottom), 
which I was change, stylize, add new desirable components reading Bootstrap documentation. Background photographs were taken by myself and I used Adobe Photoshop to enhance them. Simple tests for application were written by JUnit and Mockito. On the 'about me' page, data was consumed from Instagram API.
