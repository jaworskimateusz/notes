# Notes
Spring &amp; Hibernate web application 

## Description
Notes web application was created in order to make notes and have a quick access to them. You can create an account, login and start
using.Inputs have validation. Users password are stored in the database protected by BCrypt algorithm. You can do CRUD operations on notes.

which I was change, stylize, add new desirable components reading Bootstrap documentation.
